# QuickTimeGame
A game based on forced social interactions using quicktime events to prompt a proper response from the player.
This includes the Code for the event. No triggers are set yet. It will just cycle through 3 randomized prompts attached to keys "e","r", and "t"
My plan is to include triggers and have an NPC controlled by another script walk through them to trigger the events.
